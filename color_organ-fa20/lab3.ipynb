    "1. Build the circuit below near your mic board on the breadboard. \n",

    "<img style=\"width:500px\" src=\"images/co1_biasing.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width:500px\" src=\"images/op_amp_pinout.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, plug in one of your op amps into the 8 pin socket on your mic board. **Make sure you match the notch on the op amp to the notch on the socket and drawn on the board!!**\n",
    "2. Connect the mic board **$V_{\\text{DD}}$ to the 3.3V  rail** and **$V_{\\text{SS}}$ to the ground rail**.\n",
    "3. Make sure OS2 and OS1 on the micboard are connected to the appropriate nodes in the circuit above. \n",
    "4. Probe each node of the circuit with the multimeter to see if it matches what you would expect to see. You should be able to explain what voltage you would expect to see at each node at this point. Try turning the potentiometer all the way one way and then all the way the other way to see how it changes. \n",
    "5. **Once you know that your circuit is correct,** plug your Launchpad into your computer. **Connect one of the Launchpad's ground pins to the ground rail, but don't connect any of the Launchpad's 3.3V or 5V pins to the breadboard in ANY way.**\n",
    "6. Turn the potentiometer until the mic board output reaches its maximum, maxing out the mic board gain.\n",
    "7. Connect the mic board's output to `P6.0` on the Launchpad.\n",

    "### 1.2 Tune Your Mic Board\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload `tune_mic.ino` to your Launchpad and hit `RST`. Open the Serial Plotter. \n",
    "2. Press the button at the bottom left of the Launchpad (`P2.1`) to calibrate the readings. **Make sure the mic board gain is maxed out while this is happening.** Check to see that the values look reasonable.\n",
    "3. **Play a pure tone in the midrange** (1000 - 5000 Hz) on your phone at a reasonable volume. Make sure to point the speaker directly at the mic and hold it a few inches away from the mic. Use a [tone generator](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/) to do this, NOT a youtube video! The frequency in youtube videos is often inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Turn the potentiometer (with a screwdriver or jumper pins) until you see a sine wave with a **peak-to-peak of around 2V to 3V** on the serial plotter (it doesn't have to be precise, just around that range is fine). The plotter should have a legend at the top telling you which lines correspond to the mic board output, the peak-to-peak, and the 2.5V threshold. The peak-to-peak value is also given beside its legend title. If you tap on the mic, it should rail, but **it should not be railing while you play the tone.** Railing is nonlinear behavior and can negatively affect the performance of the rest of your circuit.\n",
    "    - If you want to change the amount of time over which the peak-to-peak value is calculated, change the DELAY variable in the Launchpad code.\n",
    "    - If the peak-to-peak reading stops being accurate, move the probe wire (the wire connecting the mic board output to `P6.0`) to the 3.3V rail and press `RST`. After the red and green LEDs at the bottom of the board turn off, you can move the probe wire back to the mic board output. \n",
    "    - If there's a non-physical spike on the serial plotter preventing you from seeing your voltages at the correct scale, try closing and reopening it. You may have to repeat the procedure outlined in the bullet point above. \n",
