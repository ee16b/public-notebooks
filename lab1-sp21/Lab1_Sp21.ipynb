    "- Make sure you use consistent colors for ground, power voltages, etc. Black is usually reserved for gnd, and red for power.\n",

    "- In general, it's better to have shorter wires, so that it's easier to follow.\n",
    "- The + and - rails are reserved for power and gnd, respectively. Avoid connecting any other signals to those rails.\n",
    "- Pay attention to how the two supply multimeters are connected, and connect the third unconnected meter appropriately to measure the input signal.\n",
    "- Make sure all voltage supplies have the same reference voltage. They should all have their negative terminals connected to the negative power rail (-).\n",
    "- DO NOT connect multiple wires to the same hole. Tinkercad lets you do this, but this is physically impossible to do on a real breadboard, so do not do this.\n",
    "- Make sure your components like resistors go into holes on the breadboard, and DO NOT have any legs dangling in empty space. Tinkercad will let you have floating components, but you can't physically do this with real hardware, so don't do this.\n",

You can click on the Code button to see the Scratch code the Arduino will be running. The code will turn on pin 13 for two seconds, and then turn it off for 2 seconds. \n",

    "Unlike some other microcontrollers, such as the MSP430 Launchpad, the Arduino has 5V logic, while the MSP430 has 3.3V logic. Fortunately, the Arduino has a 3.3V supply pin. We will use the logic pin 13 to drive a CMOS inverter switch that is powered by this 3.3V supply pin. This way, when pin 13 on the Arduino is high, the CMOS inverter will output 0V. When pin 13 is low, the CMOS inverter will output 3.3V.  This way, our TinkerCad simulation will mimic the Launchpad better. The output of the CMOS inverter is labelled P3.2 to represent P3.2 on a Launchpad.\n",
