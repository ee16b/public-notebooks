    "### Circuit Guidelines\n",
    "- Make sure you use consistent colors for ground, power voltages, etc. Black is usually reserved for GND, and red for power.\n",
    "- In general, it's better to have shorter wires, so that it's easier to follow. Your lab kits come with pre-stripped wires of different length, but if you need, feel free to use the wire strippers.\n",
    "- The + and - rails are reserved for power and GND, respectively. Avoid connecting any other signals to those rails. You will be connecting the power supply leads to your breadboard rails.\n",
    "- Make sure you connect all of your grounds, including the lab equipment's grounds, to the negative (-) rails on your breadboards. Add a wire between the two - rails so that everything in your circuit references the same ground.\n",

    "### Voltage Gain\n",

    "The __Voltage Amplification (Av)__ or __Gain__ of a voltage amplifier is given by:\n",

    "$$A_v = \\frac{\\Delta V_{out}}{\\Delta V_{in}} = \\frac{Vout(Vin_{max})-Vout(Vin_{min})}{Vin_{max}-Vin_{min}}$$\n",

    "- Connect the output of your waveform generator (the red lead) to $V_{in}$ and the ground (the black lead) to your ground rail.\n",

    "- Connect $V_{ref}$ to your 3.3V.\n",
    "- Use the oscilloscope to probe $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ simultaneously. **DO NOT insert the oscilloscope probe directly into the breadboard** - make sure you use the hook attachment connected to a wire, and probe with the wire. Make sure that the black lead of the oscilloscope probe is connected to your ground rail as well!\n",
