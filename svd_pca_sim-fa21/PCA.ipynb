    "SIXT33N is an obedient little robot that will follow the directions that you tell it. There are four moves that SIXT33N can make: move straight, move straight slowly, turn right, and turn left. However, SIXT33N does not speak human languages, and some words, like \"left\" and \"right\", sound very similar (a strong single syllable), while other words are easy to distinguish. Your job in this phase is to find four command words that are easy for SIXT33N to tell apart (consider syllables and intonation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For phase 4, you will develop the principal component analysis (PCA) classifier that allows SIXT33N to tell the difference between the four commands. You will examine several different words, and determine which ones will be easiest to sort by PCA.\n",

    "It is common practice, especially in machine learning applications, to split a dataset into a training set and a smaller test set (some common ratios for train:test are 80:20 or 70:30) when trying to make data-driven predictions/decisions. In this lab, we will collect data and split our dataset into 70% training data and 30% test data. \n",

    "Once you have some sample data collected, we will:\n",
    "1. Split our data into 2 sets: train_data and test_data\n",
    "2. Perform PCA and look at how well it separates the train_data \n",
    "3. Once you have a set of four words that you like, you will compute the means for each of those four words in the PCA basis. We will classify each word according to which mean it is closest in Euclidean distance to. \n",
    "4. To see how well our classifier does on data it has never seen before (this is called generalization in machine learning), we will project test_data onto the same PCA basis as train_data, and find the mean that is closest in Euclidean distance to each data point. \n",

In order to not lose the first couple samples of the speech command, we say that the command starts **`pre_length`** samples before the threshold is crossed.

    "\n",
    "\"Good\" audio data has a high signal-to-noise ratio. Recording words while far away from the microphone may cause your intended word to blend in with background noise. However \"oversaturation\" of the audio signal (speaking too loudly and/or too closely into the mic) will distort the signal (Why?). It's recommended to record your own words with headphones to get good audio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To record your own `wav` files, we suggest you use the [online recorder](https://online-voice-recorder.com). \n",

    "**For each chosen word, do the following:**\n",
    "1. Click on record button on the webpage, and come back to this page. \n",
    "2. **Run the script in next cell, when you see the numbers appear from 1 to 30, say the word you want to record.**\n",
    "    - The recording window is 2 second. You want to finish the word in this period. After one number appears, the next number will apear 2 seconds later. \n",
    "    - **Pronounce the word consistently and always speak around the same time relative to when the number appears.** This will help you collect data that is less \"noisy\" which will result in better classification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

But you need to convert it to `wave` file and also clip it to remove the noise singnals before the first sample and after the last sample. Another website to convert the audio files are [Convert-to-WAV](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav) and the website to trim the `wav` file is [mp3cutter](https://www.mp3cutter.com). You can also find other useful website to do this.\n"
