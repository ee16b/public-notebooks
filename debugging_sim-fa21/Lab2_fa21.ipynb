    "Voltage regulators are important circuit components in modern circuit design. They enable the use of a range of input voltages, and output very stable desired voltages, even with varying loading conditions or varying source conditions (within a certain spec of course). Voltage/current regulator ICs usually also have built in protections, such as current limit or thermal shutdown to prevent damage to your circuit.\n",

While for this task, we're going to use a CMOS inverter as a level shifter to change the logic level from 5V to 3.3V: We use the logic pin 13 of Arduino to drive a CMOS inverter switch that is powered by Arduino's 3.3V supply pin. This way, when pin 13 on the Arduino is high, the CMOS inverter will output 0V. When pin 13 is low, the CMOS inverter will output 3.3V.
