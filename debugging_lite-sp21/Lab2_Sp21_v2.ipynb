    "- Pay attention to how the one of supply multimeters are connected, and connect the second unconnected one appropriately or add more multimeters as you need.\n",

    "With both voltages measured in the same way (i.e. both RMS, both Peak, or both Peak to Peak), Av is a ratio of the output to the input. Thus, Av/gain has no units. Note that if the input is inverted, the gain is a __negative__ number.\n",

    "Voltage regulators are important circuit components in modern circuit design. They enable the use of a range of input voltages, and output very stable desired voltages, even with varying loading conditions or varying source conditions (within a certain spec, of course). Voltage/current regulator ICs usually also have built in protections, such as current limit or thermal shutdown to prevent damage to your circuit.\n",
    "\n",
