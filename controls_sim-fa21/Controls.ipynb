In these simulations, we apply maximum PWM for a short time as we do in the real car to \"jolt\" the motors from a stop.

Traveling straight means the *velocities*, not the positions, of the wheels are the same. It may just travel straight in a different direction than the original heading if $\\delta[n]\\neq 0$.
