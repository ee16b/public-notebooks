    "\n",
    "SIXT33N is an obedient little robot that will follow the directions that you tell it. There are four moves that SIXT33N can make: move straight, move straight slowly, turn right, and turn left. However, SIXT33N does not speak human languages, and some words, like \"left\" and \"right\", sound very similar (a strong single syllable), while other words are easy to distinguish. Your job in this phase is to find four command words that are easy for SIXT33N to tell apart (consider syllables and intonation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For phase 3, you will develop the PCA classifier that allows SIXT33N to tell the difference between the four commands. You will examine several different words, and determine which ones will be easiest to sort by PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side Note: Datasets in Machine Learning Applications\n",
    "It is common practice, especially in machine learning applications, to split a dataset into a training set and a smaller test set (some common ratios for train:test are 80:20 or 70:30) when trying to make data-driven predictions/decisions. In this lab, we will collect data and split our dataset into 70% training data and 30% test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Classification Procedure\n",
    "Once you have some sample data collected, we will:\n",
    "1. Split our data into 2 sets: train_data and test_data\n",
    "2. Perform PCA and look at how well it separates the train_data \n",
    "3. Once you have a set of four words that you like, you will compute the means for each of those four words in the PCA basis. We will classify each word according to which mean it is closest in Euclidean distance to. (i.e. K-nearest neighbor algorithm) \n",
    "4. To see how well our classifier does on data it has never seen before (this is called generalization in machine learning), we will project test_data onto the same PCA basis as train_data, and find the mean that is closest in Euclidean distance to each data point. \n",
    "5. When you (and your GSI) are satisfied with the classifier's accuracy, you will port the classifier into the Launchpad code in Energia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this phase are as follows:\n",
    "- Generate envelope and utilize threshold to get snippets\n",
    "- PCA + Classifier (4 commands)\n",
    "- Check accuracy\n",
    "- PCA projection on Launchpad\n",
    "\n",
    "The checkpoints (marked **<span style=\"color:green\">green</span>** in the Notebook) are:\n",
    "- Checkpoint 1: First pass through PCA with training data; GSI feedback\n",
    "- Checkpoint 2: Classification target met in Python using test data\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of this is considered a single graded lab."

    "When humans distinguish words, they listen for temporal and frequency differences to determine what is being said. However, SIXT33N does not have the memory or the processing power to distinguish words nearly as well as our human brains, so we will have to choose much simpler features for SIXT33N to look at (syllables, intonation, magnitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of speech signals, you might notice that the shape of the speech wave is a very distinctive part of each word. Taking just the shape of the magnitude of a signal is called enveloping, exemplified in the image below. So, we want to do some filtering to retrieve the envelope of the audio signal. We train the PCA off of just this envelope and build a classifier to classify new data points.\n",
