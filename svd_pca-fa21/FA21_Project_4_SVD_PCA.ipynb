    "SIXT33N is an obedient little robot that will follow the directions that you tell it. There are four moves that SIXT33N can make: move straight far, move straight close, turn left, and turn right. However, SIXT33N does not speak human languages, and some words, like \"left\" and \"right\", sound very similar (a strong single syllable), while other words are easier to distinguish. Your job in this phase is to find four command words that are easy for SIXT33N to tell apart (consider syllables and intonation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will develop the PCA classifier that allows SIXT33N to tell the difference between the four commands. You will examine several different words, and determine which ones will be easiest to classify by PCA.\n",

    "**Please read the [lab note](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vKmclZFsLs6KPv1bojH4VGsEs0vy2_5B/view?usp=sharing). It explains in detail what you will be doing in each part of the lab.**\n",

    "### Side Note: Datasets in Machine Learning Applications\n",
    "It is common practice, especially in machine learning applications, to split a dataset into a training set and a smaller test set (some common ratios for train:test are 80:20 or 70:30) when trying to make data-driven predictions/decisions. In this lab, we will collect data and split our dataset into 70% training data and 30% test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Classification Procedure\n",
    "Once you have some sample data collected, we will:\n",
    "1. Split our data into 2 sets: train_data and test_data\n",
    "2. Perform PCA and look at how well it separates the train_data \n",
    "3. Once you have a set of four words that you like, you will compute the means for each of those four words in the PCA basis. We will classify each word according to which mean it is closest in Euclidean distance to. \n",
    "4. To see how well our classifier does on data it has never seen before (this is called generalization in machine learning), we will project test_data onto the same PCA basis as train_data, and find the mean that is closest in Euclidean distance to each data point. \n",
    "5. Make sure you (and your GSI) are satisfied with the classifier's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this phase are as follows:\n",
    "- Generate envelope and utilize threshold to get snippets\n",
    "- PCA + Classifier (4 commands)\n",

    "When humans distinguish words, they listen for temporal and frequency differences to determine what is being said. However, SIXT33N does not have the memory or the processing power to distinguish words nearly as well as our human brains, so we will have to choose much simpler features for SIXT33N to look at (syllables, intonation, magnitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of speech signals, you might notice that the shape of the speech wave is a very distinctive part of each word. Taking just the shape of the magnitude of a signal is called enveloping, exemplified in the image below. So, we want to do some filtering to retrieve the envelope of the audio signal. We train the PCA off of just this envelope and build a classifier to classify new data points.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we will record 40 audio samples for each of your 6 chosen words. We recommend each partner records 3 words each, to maximize variance between our recorded signals. Again, think about how to make the words distinct from others (syllable count, intontation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your breadboard is powered and you see an audio signal at the microphone front end circuit's output! **Also make sure P6.0 on Launchpad is connected to the microphone front end circuit output (output of non-inverting amplifier for low-pass filter)!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each chosen word, do the following:**\n",
    "1. Upload the sketch **`collect-data-envelope.ino`** to your Launchpad.\n",
    "    - This sketch records 2 seconds of audio sampled every 0.35ms at a time and sends it to your computer.\n",
    "    - When the red LED is on, the Launchpad is recording audio. Say the word to the micboard right after the red LED blinks on. \n",
    "2. Run **`python collect-data-envelope.py YOUR_WORD.csv`**.\n",
    "    - Download the collect-data-envelope folder to your local computer. Press Shift + right click within the file explorer to view the option to \"Open PowerShell window here\".\n",
    "    - Open the PowerShell terminal and navigate to the directory with the `collect-data-envelope.py` script and then run the above command.\n",
    "    - Make sure the serial monitor/plotter in Energia is closed before running the script!\n",
    "    - This program will capture audio data collected by the Launchpad and write it to `YOUR_WORD.csv`. You should see a console output in your PowerShell terminal after each sample is recorded. \n",
    "    - Choose your words carefully! Think about the PCA algorithm and what characterstics of your word might affect its output.\n",
    "    - After you collect a few test words, check `YOUR_WORD.csv` and make sure that it looks like a sound wave as opposed to being full of 0s. *It might help to plot the data in Excel.*\n",
    "3. **When the red light goes on, say the word you want to record.**\n",
    "    - **Pronounce the word consistently and always speak around the same time relative to when the red light turns on.** This will help you collect data that is less \"noisy\" which will result in better classification.\n",
    "    - The red LED on the launch pad is like a recording room. When the red light goes on, the Launchpad is recording. Say the word you want to record before the red LED turns off.\n",
    "4. Once you've recorded ~40 audio samples of the word, stop the python program (e.g. by pressing Ctrl + C in the command prompt).\n",
    "5. Go into the .csv file and delete outlier samples such that you are left with **exactly 30 audio recordings of the word**. We recommend deleting the first and last couple samples, as well as samples whose values look very different compared to other samples at the same timesteps. The best way to help you identity outlier samples is to plot the data in Excel. Plot all your samples using a line plot. **Don't spend too much time with this,** our enveloping function in Part 3 also helps with some of the outliers!\n",
    "6. If you are working on the lab on DataHub, you will need to upload your `.csv` files to DataHub into the `PCA_data` folder so the jupyter notebook can access them.\n",

    "You may realize in the next section that one or two of your words are not sorting quite as well as you would like. Don't be afraid to come back to this section and try collecting different words based on what you have learned makes a word sortable. "
