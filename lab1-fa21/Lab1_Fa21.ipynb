    "Tinkercad is a virtual tool you can use to build and simulate circuits with various different components. It's a useful tool for prototyping circuits before building them physically, allowing you to plan and test the placement of parts and wires. Tinkercad uses some elements and components that may be different from the parts we use in the hands-on kit, which we'll point out to you, but be mindful of this when comparing Tinkercad circuits and our physical circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get familiar with Tinkercad, we will start by creating a simple op-amp buffering circuit with LED lighting driven by a square wave that's generated by the Arduino microcontroller, to help you get familiar with using op-amps and microcontrollers before the next labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starter Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have created a Tinkercad account, the steps to which are in the Getting Started with Tinkercad guide.\n",

    "- Breadboard\n",
    "- 1 DC Power Supply\n",
    "- 1 capacitor\n",
    "- 2 resistors\n",
    "- 2 LEDs\n",
    "- Arduino (similar to MSP430 Launchpad)\n",
    "- Multimeters\n",
    "- Op-amp\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breadboard and layout\n",
    "To help you organize, look at the figure below. It shows the diagram of the board, and places for utilizing important components and reserved rails. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img width=\"700px\" src=\"images/Tinker_layout.png\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will organize the breadboard in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top and bottom + power rails will be 5V, while the - rails will be GND.\n",
    "- Block A35-J38 will be reserved for the op-amp chip. We will explain the pinout and wire routing later. Chips like the op-amp MUST straddle the \"notch\" (the trench stretching the length of the breadboard). This is so you don't accidentally short the legs on opposite sides of the chip together.\n",
    "- Column 37F-37J is the pin where the signal from the microcontroller (Pin 13) will be connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "$*$ The decoupling cap placed between power rails and ground is used to remove AC noise from the supply and help stablize the voltage of the power rails relative to ground (more on this in future labs later on in the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Guidelines\n",
    "#### General Circuit Rules\n",
    "- Make sure you use consistent colors for ground, power voltages, etc. Black is usually reserved for GND, and red for power.\n",
    "- Try not to have any excessively long wires; shorten them so that it's easier to follow and debug later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tinkercard Tips\n",
    "- Pay attention to how the two supply multimeters are connected, and connect the third unconnected meter appropriately to measure the signal of interest.\n",
    "- For easier readability of your layout, when creating wires, it is possible to add bends by \"clicking their path\". Try to avoid crossing wires as much as you can for better visualization, and use different colors for different signals if possible.\n",
    "- DO NOT connect multiple wires or component legs to the same hole. Tinkercad lets you do this, but this is physically impossible to do on a real breadboard, so do not do this.\n",
    "- Make sure your components like resistors go into holes on the breadboard, and DO NOT have any legs dangling in empty space. Tinkercad will let you have floating components, but you can't physically do this with real hardware, so don't do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circuit Power Rails\n",
    "- The + and - rails are reserved for power and GND, respectively. Avoid connecting any other signals to those rails.\n",
    "- Make sure all voltage supplies have the same reference voltage. They should all have their negative terminals connected to the negative power rail (-), which is GND.\n",
    "- The + and - long rails on the sides of the breadboards are not connected to their corresponding rail on the other side. Make sure to ALWAYS connect your - rails so that both sides of the breadboard have easy access to GND. Do not connect your + rails unless you want them to carry the same voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LEDs are polarized!\n",
    "- Note that LEDs have polarity, meaning the direction you plug it into the circuit matters.\n",
    "- The anode (+) is the longer/crooked leg of the LED, while the cathode (-) is the shorter/straight leg of the LED.\n",
    "- If you reverse the direction of the LED, the current will not be able to flow and the LED will not light up.\n",

    "#### Wiring the op-amp as a buffer\n",
    "TinkerCad simulates the [LM741](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/LM741-op-amp-pinout-connections) operational amplifier. It is an 8 legged component with the pinout shown below:\n",

You can click on the Code button to see the Scratch code the Arduino will be running. The code will turn on pin 13 for two seconds, and then turn it off for 2 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some other microcontrollers, such as the MSP430 Launchpad, which has 3.3V logic, the Arduino has 5V logic. This means that for a logic HIGH signal, the Arduino's pins will output 5V (approximately, it won't be exactly 5V), while the Launchpad outputs 3.3V (approximately).\n",

    "    - 50% duty cycle (1/2 time on, 1/2 time off during a cycle)\n",
    "    - 5 volts peak-to-peak (Vpp). Peak-to-peak means the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the wave.\n",
    "    - 2.5V offset (the wave is centered vertically around 2.5V)\n",
    "\\*When measuring the input signal generated by the Arduino, you may see that it does not actually reach 5V, even approximately. This is because of the \"loading\" effect of R1 and LED1. This pair of components is demanding more current than the Arduino pin can supply, so the output voltage of the pin drops below 5V.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect Pin 13 of your Arduino to the input of your buffer circuit.\n",
    "- Connect the ground of the Arduino to the negative power rail (-) (which should be connected to $V_{ss}$), so that the Arduino uses the same voltage reference as the other voltage supplies. \n",
    "- You need to power the op-amp with 5V in order for it to operate. Connect the correct DC voltages to $V_{\\text{dd}}$ and $V_{\\text{ss}}$.\n",
