    "Voltage regulators are important circuit components in modern circuit design. They enable the use of a range of input voltages, and output very stable desired voltages, even with varying loading conditions or varying source conditions (within a certain spec of course). Voltage/current regulator ICs usually also have built in protections, such as current limit or thermal shutdown to prevent damage to your circuit.\n",

We will use it as a voltage source for $3.3V$ -- but that can be easily changed by using different resistors. The way the LM317 works is that it has internal circuitry (using opamps as well!) that keeps a stable $1.2V$ between the adjust pin and the output.  The resistance of $R_1 || R_2  = 0.500 k\\Omega$, so the total current through them will sum to $\\frac{1.2V}{0.5 k\\Omega} = 2.4mA$. That is also the total current going through $R_3 || R_4=0.86 k\\Omega$. So the voltage across $R_3$ and $R_4$ will be $2.06V$.
