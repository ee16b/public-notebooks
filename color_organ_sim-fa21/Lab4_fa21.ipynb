    "\n",
    "As it is hard to read the waveform amplitude from oscilloscope, we use the Arduino to read the filter output signal and plot it with the serial plotter. In this way, we make a oscilloscope by ourselves.\n",

    "1. Open the TinkerCad code by clicking on `Code` (make sure you're on Text, not Block) and skim the code. Try to understand how it works.\n",

    "    \n",

    "2. For the function generator, double check that the **Amplitude** is **4V**, the **DC Offset** is **0V**, and the **Function** is **Sine**.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Hit `Start Simulation`.** \n",
    "4. Open the serial plotter by clicking on `Code > Serial Monitor > Graph`. You may need to wait for a while to see the waveform (the waiting time will be longer when the frequency becomes higher). *Does the output look like what you expect?*\n",
    "    - You may find that the offset voltage of the serial monitor waveform is 2.5V. The reason is that the Arduino GND is connected to -Vss supply instead of GND.\n",
    "    - You can change the frequency of function generator while in simulation! You will see the transition behavior between two frequencies like below!\n",
    "    \n",
