    "### 1.0 Plan Your Breadboard Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide your breadboard into the following sections so that you have room for them all.\n",
    "- Use both of your (+) rails for 3.3V because most of the circuit will use 3.3V. Plug in the output of your 3.3V regulator into these rails.\n",
    "- Plug your 5V output into a row close to your mic board (or somewhere in the middle of your breadboard if you're not using the mic board anymore)\n",
    "- Connect the ground of all your supplies, and connect the two (-) to create your ground rail.\n",
    "- The purple section is where you will build your mic board front end circuits if you want to do voice control later.\n",
    "- The blue sections are where you will build your motor driver circuits.\n",

    "### 1.1 Test your voltage regulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SIXT33N will run on a 9V battery when it is running around. \n",
    "- A voltage regulator regulates this 9V down to 5V.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are going to be working with some small signals. You don't want to introduce more noise than you need to, and the power rails can be a large source of noise. To keep some noise off of your power rails:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Add a decoupling capacitor (10 uF, code 106) between your 3.3 V rail and ground (if you don't already have one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoupling capacitors will reduce fluctuations on your rails (which can occur for example when the voltage source must supply a large amount of current across wires which actually have non-zero resistance and inductance) .  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor) You should use them in every circuit you build <i>in the future for the rest of your life</i>.\n"

In order to minimize noise, we want to only collect data inside this frequency range. Additionally, the mic board has a bandpass transfer function. The lowpass cutoff frequency is a bit too high for our liking, so we'll build a lowpass filter to bring the higher frequency cutoff down to about 2.5 kHz. \n",
