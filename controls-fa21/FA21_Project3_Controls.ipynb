However, we want the car to travel in (approximately) the same direction as when it starts moving. We can accomplish this by manually add the known steady state error $\\delta_{ss}$ to each calculation of the error $\\delta$. Accounting for the known $\\delta_{ss}$ helps the model better respond to unexpected pertubations affecting $\\delta$, increasing the model's control strength.\n",
