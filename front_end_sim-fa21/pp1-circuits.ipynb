    "\n",
    "1. **The motor has 6 pins.** The two leftmost pins are the driving pins that you are going to connect according to the motor controller schematic in part 2.2 to drive the motor. The other 4 pins are for the encoder module, which outputs a single pulse on channel A and B whenever the motor rotates for a specific amount. Channel A and B are identical, except for a quadrature phase difference which helps with identifying the direction of the rotation. Essentially, the two channels are the same waveform, except one is the delayed version of the other, and depending on which one is delayed, we can identify the directon of the rotation.\n",

If the motor is on and we turn it off, the inductive behavior of the motor maintains the current and we need a way to dissipate it when the BJT is off. The diagram for the diode is shown below. **Note that the diode has a direction** - be careful which terminal is connected to the 9V power supply.\n",
